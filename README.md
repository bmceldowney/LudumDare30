Ludum Dare 30
=============

What it is
----------

Ludum Dare is an accelerated video game development competition. Participants have
one weekend to build a game from scratch, and then submit them for review where they
will be judged on many different criteria including gameplay mechanics, story and
graphics.

How to build it
---------------

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ninjascribble/LudumDare30.git
$ cd LudumDare30
$ npm install
...
$ grunt
```

It might take a while to install all the **npm** and **bower** dependencies
(PhaserJS is pretty huge).

Running `grunt` will build the project, immediately launch it in your browser
and start a **livereload** service that will watch for changes. Pretty sweet!
